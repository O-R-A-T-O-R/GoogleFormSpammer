$ python main.py

After the first run of main.py, config.json will be created and filled with empty fields

config.json - 3 fields: link, threads, amount
To get started, you need to fill in all the fields

The warnings and errors tell you what is happening and should be easy enough to understand

I hope, this is clear enough (-_-)
